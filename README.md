# German-Tank-Problem

This project exercises a statistical method that was used in WWII to accurately estimate German tank production by analyzing serial numbers on the captured tanks.

This goes through 3 different estimators: the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), the method of moments (MOM), and the third unbiased estimator.

We find out that the third estimator is the best estimator out of the three.
