# German-Tank-Problem

This project exercises a statistical method that was used in WWII to accurately estimate German tank production by analyzing serial numbers on the captured tanks.

This goes through 3 different estimators: the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), the method of moments (MOM), and the third unbiased estimator.

We find out that the third unbiased estimator is the best estimator out of the three. Which is the one the Allies used during WWII
